# State

## Essential Question
1. What is the difference between _state_ and _props_?
2. What is the `useState` hook? What does `useState` return?

## Code Challenge
It's highly recommended you use the scaffolding tool [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) to create your starter code. Run the command `npx create-react-app <name-of-your-app>`. Then `cd` into your newly created project and run `npm start`.

You will make a `MultiLingualGreeting` component:
* It should render as a greeting (perhaps, "Good Morning") in English. 
* Beneath this greeting, there should be a series of buttons. 
* Each button should correspond to a different language (perhaps, "Spanish", "Haitian Creole", and "Portuguese"). 
* When a button is clicked, the greeting above should be translated to the appropriate language.
